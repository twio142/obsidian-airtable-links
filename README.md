# Obsidian Airtable Links

Fetch links from **my** personal Airtable setup, which I use as a bookmark manager / read-it-later.

The base has two tables:

- **Links** – stores individual links.
- **List** – stores collections of links.

This plugin retrieves links from a given list.

You can then use the **Dataview API** to render the links in Obsidian.
